# JuzzyConstrained
Java library based on Juzzy for the implementation of constrained interval type-2 fuzzy sets and systems.

The library currently supports the following membership functions:
* Triangular
* Gaussian
* Gauangle
* Trapezoidal

The implemented type-reduction algorithms are:
* Sampling method [1]
* Switch indiced [2]

The software library has been presented at the IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI) 2020. For additional information regarding the use of the library, please refer to the original paper [3].
